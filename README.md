# How to Add Project to Your Device from GitHub

  <li>Install <a href = https://git-scm.com/downloads>Git</a> if you haven't already</li>
  <li>Copy the project by selecting "<> Code" at the top of the page and Copy the link displayed</li>
  <li>Search your device for "Git Bash" and open it</li>
  <li>Type in <kbd>git clone (link)</kbd> and use the link you copied</li>
  <li>Type <kbd>ls</kbd> to see where the folder has been placed (it is most likely in the Users folder on your device)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Feel free to move the folder to wherever you like</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Open Unity Hub and select "Add" from the projects menu</li>
  <li>Find the Topdown_RPG file and open until you get to the folder with the assets, packages, etc. and select "Open"</li>
  <li>You should now have the project's main branch avaliable to open in the Unity Editor</li>

After this, your project may not have the desired code or assets

See [How to Manage Branches](#how-to-manage-branches) to fix this

# How to Manage Branches
<ol>
  <li>Open Git Bash and navigate to the project directory</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you do not know how to traverse directories to get to your project, use <a href = https://support.cs.wm.edu/index.php/tips-and-tricks/basic-linux-commands>this resource</a> for guidance</li>
    <li>You will mainly be using <kbd>cd</kbd> and <kbd>ls</kbd></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Use <kbd>git branch -a</kbd> to list all of the project's branches</li>
  <li>To work on a branch, add it to your device and switch to it by using <kbd>git checkout (branch name)</kbd></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes, there may be conflicts. Git will tell you what files are conflicting and how to fix it</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Your Unity project should now have the branch's data</li>
</ol>

# How to Push (Add Your Changes) and Pull (Update Your Project)
